Submission folder `submissions/<your_folder>/week_3/day_6/assignments`
**NOTE: Write clean code and break the problem into smaller functions**

### FSD.M2.B.1
- File `reverseInteger.js`
- Given an integer, write a function to reverse it
### FSD.M2.B.2
- File `stringsPlay.js` 
- Should have the following functions `camelCase` `snakeCase` `hypenCase` which takes a string as input and returns the string the respective case
- You cannot use any inbuilt functions, the only things you can use are the `length` `push` 
### FSD.M2.B.3
- File `pyramidPlay.js`
- Should have three functions to print the pyramid , inverse pyramid  and rhombus based on the given level
**Sample Level 4 Pyramid**
```
....O....
...O.O...
..O.O.O..
.O.O.O.O.
```
**Sample Level 4  Inverse Pyramid**
```
.O.O.O.O.
..O.O.O..
...O.O...
....O....
```
**Sample Level 4 Rhombus**
```
....O....
...O.O...
..O.O.O..
.O.O.O.O.
..O.O.O..
...O.O...
....O....
```
### FSD.M2.B.4
- File `palindrome.js`
- Create a func that takes a string as input, and determines if it is a palindrome
- Do not use in-built functions
```
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as "taco cat" or "madam" or "racecar" or the number 10801.
```
### FSD.M2.B.5
- File `rotateMatrix.js`
- Given a 2D array, rotate the array by 90 degrees clockwise
- You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly.
- DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
```
// This is a 3x3 matrix
Given matrixInput = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],
rotate the matrixInput in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
```
