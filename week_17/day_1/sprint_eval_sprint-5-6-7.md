Your aim is to build a meeting room booking application

- In the `home page` a user can see a list of all meeting rooms available for booking
- Create some placeholder data.
- In the `home page` should be able to search information of `available` meeting rooms
- The following details are mandatory for each room
    - floor on which the room is located
    - meeting room name
    - capacity
    - price per day
- Show the token after login in a navbar of the page
- Navbar should contain `home` page, and a `orders` page

- A user can select start date and end date and search for meeting rooms that fit in that timeframe
- Once a selection is made, a user should be shown a `booking page` where a bill with the booking id, and transaction details should be shown to the user
- Once confirmed, a user is sent to a confirmation page showing success where in 5 seconds after going to confirmation page, they are sent back to the dashboard page
- If a user searches again during that time frame, the meeting room which was booked should not be shown in the results

- User should be able to do the following things as well:
    - Feature to `sort` based on `price` `capacity` in `ascending` or `descending` order
    - Feature to `filter` based on `floor` also should be made.
    - Add pagination for 5 per page results
    - Show no of pages as well. 

EXTRA FEATURES (DO ONLY IF YOU HAVE EXTRA TIME):

- User should be able to see all bookings from a `orders` page. 
- You can see bookings made by other users also (without the price)
- If the booking is made by a user then he can click on that room see their bill. 
- The user can delete that booking from there
