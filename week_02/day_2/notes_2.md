## Week 2 - Day 2

### Cascading Style Sheets (Part-5)

```html
<div id="id1">
    <div id="id2">
        <div id="id3">
            <p id="id4">
                Some Text
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="id5">
            Some Text
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="id6">
        Some Text
    </div>
</div>
```

- **Child node**: A node *directly* inside another node `id2` and `id6` are child nodes of `id1`  also `id3` is child node of `id2` and `id4` is child node of `id3`
- **Descendant node**: A node *anywhere* inside another node. `id2` and `id6` are child nodes of `id1` and also descendants. `id3` `id4` `id5` are not child nodes of `id1` but descendants
- **Sibling nodes**: Nodes that sit on the same level. In the above example `id2` and `id6` are siblings and `id3` and `id5` are also siblings

**Inheritance**

In CSS, inheritance controls what happens when no value is specified for a property on an element. Refer to any CSS property definition to see whether a specific property inherits by default ("Inherited: yes") or not ("Inherited: no").

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color - `Inherited  yes`  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border - `Inherited  no`

**Important**

In CSS, there is a special piece of syntax you can use to make sure that a certain declaration will *always* win over all others: `!important` (even inline css)

**Pseudo Classes**

A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s).   
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes

```css
selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}
```

**Pseudo Element** 

A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s).  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements

```css
selector::pseudo-element {
  property: value;
}
```

**Specificity**

The amount of specificity a selector has is measured using four different values (or components), which can be thought of as thousands, hundreds, tens and ones â€” four single digits in four columns:

1000 - Inline/Style Tag  
Hundreds - One for each ID Selector  
Tens - One for each class selector, attribute selector, pseudo-class contained inside the overall selector.  
Ones - One for each element selector,  pseudo-element contained inside the overall selector.  

**Note: Universal selector (*), combinators (+, >, ~, ' ') and negation pseudo-class (:not) have no effect on specificity.**



|  Selector  |  Thousands  |  Hundreds  |  Tens  |  Ones  |  Total  |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------- | ----- | ---- | ---- |
| h1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0001 |
| h1 + p | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0002 |
| h1 + p::first-letter | 0 | 0 | 0 |3 |0003|
| li > a[href*="en-US"] > .inline-warning |0 | 0 | 2 | 2 |0022|
| .class1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0010 |
| ul.class1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0011 |
| #id1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0100 |
| style | 1 | 0 | 0 |0 |1000|
