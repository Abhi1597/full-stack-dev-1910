#### Assignment - RJS.3.1

**SUBMISSION:**

- Go to `week_8/day_3/assignment` 
- Make a react app with the name `firstname_secondname` with your first name and last name  


- **Make sure to include this MarkDown file in your submission with checked boxes for all parts you have completed.**


**NOTE:** Follow the instructions carefully and follow coding discipline

**NOTE2:** Indent your code correctly and stick to one kind of naming style

**NOTE3:** All components must be in different files and within a `Components`folder. CSS can be shared between components if desired. CSS modules must also be in your components folder. 

**NOTE4:** All static files like images must be in the public folder.

**NOTE5:** All compoenents files must have the same name as their compoenents. Eg: `App` must be in `App.js`.

**NOTE6:** You must only call `ReactDOM.render` once in your index.js file! 

**NOTE7**: Commit your code to your remote branch regularly and meaningfully.(Don't commit to master!) This can help you manage your project during development incase you need to return to any old code. 

Within the react App,  delete all files from the src folder and create your own files!

## Learning objectives:
- Using listeners in react.
- Modifying state using `setInterval`
- Using lifecycle methods
- Conditional Rendering

## Final Goal

The goal of this project should be to create a clone of the Google countdown timer and stopwatch.

You can see this by either searching google for "stopwatch" or visiting this link [https://www.google.com/search?q=stopwatch](https://www.google.com/search?q=stopwatch).

## Minimum Viable Product

MVP or minimum viable product is the least amount of functionality you must have done by the end of today.

You don't need to focus on styles for the MVP.

- [ ] You must have implemented a stopwatch that lets you start, stop and reset. 
- [ ] The stopwatch must display the number of seconds and milliseconds. 
- [ ] The timer must allow a user to manually enter the time using an inputbox, ***in seconds***.
- [ ] The user should be able to start, stop and reset the timer. 
- [ ] The use should be able to toggle between the timer and the stopwatch using tabs just like the google timer. 

## Stretch Goals

If you are able to complete the MVP in time, implement this additional functionality. 
This must be completed within the end of the next day.

- [ ] The stopwatch must also display the minutes and hours.
- [ ] The timer must also  display the minutes and hours.
- [ ] The timer must allow the user to input the time in seconds minutes and hours just like the Google timer.
