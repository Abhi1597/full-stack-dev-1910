### Week 5

## Project Day

Design and implement a project picked by you!

For some of the API's you need to **sign up** on the website and get the API key. 

It looks something like this `$2a$10$Tu9pmPwtr.huHjGV99ykB.Xb2eIQHnbuK/hfAqIKCe6BllB7gY/MW`. This looks like a bunch of random characters but computers can understand this!

Once you have the API key you can try different routes using Postman

All projects are based on your creativity but, follow the guidelines below.

**NOTE: Quicly test if you are able to make the API requests using the browser (you should not see a CORS error) if you face any issue switch the project**

**Guidelines:**

- Your webpage must contain images/icons. Make it look presentable.  
- Write base structure of your webpage in HTML/CSS and Bootstrap.
- Use JavaScript to get data from the API and then append elements after you get some data (You can also use jQuery).
- Many API's limit the number of requests you can make to the server. Do not make more than 1000 requests. Do not put your request in a Loop!


**SUBMISSION**

- Create the project in `~/projects/masai/sprint-3`
- The project should be made available on your github http://github.com account with the repository name `masai-sprint-3`
