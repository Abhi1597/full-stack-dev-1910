## Learning objectives:
- Basic Routing with React Router
- Building a Scalable Application

Create something like this:
- [https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopify-stores](https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopify-stores).

As we continue to learn more about React Router should be implementing new features. 

For inspiration on your design take a look at these websites:
-  [https://www.tannergoods.com/](https://www.tannergoods.com/)
- [https://hauslondon.com/](https://hauslondon.com/)
- [https://www.studioproper.com/](https://www.studioproper.com/)
- [https://www.apple.com/](https://www.apple.com/)

Pick a group of products you like and create a website around selling that line of products. 

Examples: Clothes, paintings, electronics etc. Be creative!

The pages you design do not have to contain content right now. However they should still render different components.

The following should be common for every page of your application:

## RJS.6.2
- [ ] Your website must contain a navigation bar with links to different product categories and other pages.

## RJS.6.3
- [ ] Your website must contain a banner at the very top advertising an ongoing deal or coupon code.

## RJS.6.4
- [ ] You website must contain a footer with some social media icons and some links for FAQ, Job opportunities etc.

## RJS.6.5
- [ ] A Shopping Cart Icon on your navigation bar. This does not have to do anything for now.

**The following are routes/pages you must have:**
## RJS.6.6
- [ ] Products categories depending on the kind of product you have. Eg: A clothing store would have Mens, Womens, Unisex etc. It is up to you.
- [ ] About Us Page.
- [ ] FAQ page.
- [ ] Contact Us page.
