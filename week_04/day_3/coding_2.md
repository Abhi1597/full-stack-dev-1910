### FSD JS.8.2

Create an index.html file. You must fill in valid `id` and other attributes for these elements to make the buttons work. 

Using Javascript do the following:

When the user clicks the button the following must happen:  
1. If the user is older than 18 print `You can drive in India!` in the `p` tag.  
2. If the user is younger than 18 print `You can't drive in India` in the `p` tag.  
3. If the user is exactly 18 years old print `You are just old enough to drive in India!` in the `p` tag.

### FSD JS.8.3

Using JavaScript do the following:

1. When the button `Click here to change my color` is clicked, the color of the button must change according to the text input. Eg: If the text input is `red` the color of the button must also change to red!

### FSD JS.8.4

For this section you would have noticed the a empty 
`select` element.

Within the select you must have the following options, the options must also have the same `value` as given below:  

- `India`
- `United States of America`
- `China`
- `Nepal`
- `Australia`
- `France`
- `Germany`
- `South Africa`
- `Nigeria`
- `Mexico`
- `Argentina`
- `Brazil`
- `Canada`
- `Singapore`
- `Sweden`  

eg: 

```html
<select id = "continent_select">
	<option value = "India"> India </option>	
</select>
```

Now using Javascript do the following:

1. When the button `Find continent` is clicked, you must output an `alert` on the page which contains the text `The continent is <name of continent>`  
Eg: If the input is `India` -> `The continent is Asia`  
    If the input is `Argentina` -> `The continent is South America`  

This link [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_continents](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_continents) shows you the continents for each country if you are unsure. 

**Hint:** Use a Switch statement!
